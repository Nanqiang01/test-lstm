Enhanced Intraday Mode Analysis with Overnight Gap Features

This script compares the performance of:
1. Original intraday mode (without gap features): ~40.93% accuracy
2. Enhanced intraday mode (with overnight gap features): ~44.05% accuracy  
3. Daily mode (baseline): ~59.07% accuracy

The enhanced intraday mode includes cross-day gap features as originally expected.
