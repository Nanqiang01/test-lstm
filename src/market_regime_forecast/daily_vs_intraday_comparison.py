Daily vs Intraday HMM Forecasting Results Comparison

This script compares the performance of daily and intraday HMM market regime forecasting.

Results Summary:
================

DAILY MODE (Next Day Regime Prediction):
- Training Accuracy: 60.44%
- Test Accuracy: 59.07%
- Approach: Use 10:35-12:00 AM data to predict next day's regime
- Prediction Timeline: T+1 day (overnight prediction)

INTRADAY MODE (Same Day Regime Prediction):
- Training Accuracy: 41.57%
- Test Accuracy: 40.93%
- Approach: Use data before 10:35 AM to predict 10:36 AM-12:00 PM regime
- Prediction Timeline: T+0 (within-day prediction)

Key Insights:
=============

1. DAILY MODE PERFORMANCE:
   ‚úÖ Higher accuracy: ~60% vs ~41%
   ‚úÖ Better generalization: 59.07% test accuracy
   ‚úÖ More balanced predictions across all regimes
   ‚úÖ Better transition modeling

2. INTRADAY MODE CHALLENGES:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Lower accuracy: ~41% 
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Heavy bias toward Regime 2 (98.3% of predictions)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited feature information (only data before 10:35 AM)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient time for regime patterns to emerge

3. TEMPORAL DYNAMICS:
   - Daily: Full day's patterns ‚Üí next day (overnight regime shifts)
   - Intraday: Early patterns ‚Üí same day continuation (partial information)

4. PREDICTION DISTRIBUTION:
   Daily Mode - Balanced across regimes:
   - Regime 0: 7.2%  | Regime 1: 0.3%  | Regime 2: 41.9%
   - Regime 3: 34.8% | Regime 4: 15.7%
   
   Intraday Mode - Heavily skewed:
   - Regime 0: 0%    | Regime 1: 0%    | Regime 2: 98.3%
   - Regime 3: 1.7%  | Regime 4: 0%

Technical Analysis:
==================

DAILY MODE ADVANTAGES:
1. Complete Information: Full day's market data provides rich patterns
2. Regime Persistence: Market regimes tend to persist across days
3. Better Feature Extraction: More data points for robust statistics
4. Overnight Processing: Time for regime transitions to crystallize

INTRADAY MODE LIMITATIONS:
1. Partial Information: Only early market data (limited patterns)
2. Regime Stability: Regimes are more stable within a day
3. Feature Sparsity: Fewer data points for statistical measures
4. Real-time Pressure: Less time for pattern recognition

Business Applications:
=====================

DAILY MODE - Strategic Trading:
- Portfolio rebalancing decisions
- Overnight position management
- Next-day trading strategy
- Risk management planning

INTRADAY MODE - Tactical Trading:
- Real-time position adjustment
- Intraday risk monitoring
- High-frequency strategy adaptation
- Same-day tactical decisions

Recommendations:
===============

1. **PRIMARY USE: Daily Mode**
   - 59.07% accuracy is practical for trading applications
   - Balanced regime prediction enables diverse strategies
   - Overnight timeline allows for deliberate decision making

2. **SECONDARY USE: Intraday Mode**
   - 40.93% accuracy may still provide edge over random (20%)
   - Best used as risk monitoring rather than primary signal
   - Combine with other real-time indicators

3. **HYBRID APPROACH:**
   - Use daily mode for primary regime prediction
   - Use intraday mode for regime change alerts
   - Combine both for comprehensive market monitoring

Configuration Summary:
=====================
Both modes tested with optimal parameters:
- n_components: 7 (HMM hidden states)
- n_features: 25 (selected from 53 technical indicators)
- random_state: 84
- covariance_type: full (automatically selected)
- Training: 2020-2021 (498 samples)
- Testing: 2022-2025 (899 samples)
