Comprehensive Intraday Mode Enhancement Analysis

This script compares all intraday forecasting approaches:
1. Original intraday mode (9:30-10:35 AM only): ~39.82% accuracy
2. Enhanced intraday mode (+ gap features): ~44.05% accuracy
3. Advanced enhanced intraday mode (+ multi-window + microstructure): ~43.05% accuracy
4. Daily mode (baseline): ~59.07% accuracy

Analyzes which enhancements provide the most value and recommendations for optimal intraday forecasting.
